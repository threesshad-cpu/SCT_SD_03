## 🚀 Project Overview
**Sudoku Titan Omega** is a professional-grade **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** demonstration tool. It features a high-speed **Backtracking AI** optimized with visual search-tree logging, a **Procedural Shuffle Engine** for infinite variations, and a fully interactive **Robotic Persona**.

> **"Initiating Quantum Logic. I am peeking at the grid sectors now."** — *Omega Engine*

## 🌟 Elite Engineering Features

### 🧠 **Quantum AI Solver (MRV Heuristic)**
* **Heuristic Optimization:** Implements **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** to prioritize cells with the lowest entropy, solving even "Pro" 9x9 grids in under 5 seconds.
* **Visual Logic Trace:** A real-time console provides a diagnostic log of the AI's "thought process," tracking every testing and backtracking event.
* **Algorithmic Heatmap:** Cells that cause high logic friction dynamically glow red to visualize backtracking density.



### 🔀 **Procedural Shuffle Engine**
* **Infinite Variations:** The backend utilizes mathematical rotations, transpositions, and symmetry swaps to generate thousands of unique unsolved matrices from seed data.
* **Ordered Difficulty Scaling:** Features 5 distinct, mission-ready levels: **Noob**, **Beginner**, **Casual**, **Smart**, and **Pro**.

### 🤖 **Interactive AI Avatar & Voice**
* **Dynamic Avatar:** A Lottie-powered robot avatar that physically "leans in" to peek at grid sectors during the solve process.
* **Standard Robot Voice:** Integrated a clear, high-pitched robotic voice (Pitch: 1.6, Rate: 1.1) to communicate mission status.
* **Reactive Personality:** The avatar blinks during calculations and performs a visual "wink" (brightness flash) upon successful completion.

### 🎨 **Professional Soft UI (Neumorphism)**
* **Tacit Aesthetics:** A fully centered, professional dashboard utilizing CSS Neumorphism for a tactile, extruded look.
* **Dual-Theme Mode:** Supports real-time toggling between **Light** and **Dark** modes to adapt to any environment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python & Flask (Logic Routing & Procedural Shuffling)
* **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6+), CSS Grid/Flexbox
* **Animations:** LottieFiles (Avatar Engine) & Canvas Confetti
* **AI Logic:** Recursive Backtracking + MRV Heuristic Optimization
